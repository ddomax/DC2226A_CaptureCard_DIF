Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.
